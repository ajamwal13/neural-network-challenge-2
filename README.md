# neural-network-challenge-2

This project builds a neural network to help HR predict employee attrition (will they leave?) and department suitability. The model uses shared layers to extract key features, then branches out for department (multi-class) and attrition (binary) prediction. While accuracy is used for initial evaluation, further improvements can be explored through hyperparameter tuning, more complex architectures, and additional metrics.
